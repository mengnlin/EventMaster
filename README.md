[Event Master Live Demo](https://event-master.herokuapp.com/)


Eventmaster is an event listing/booking site, in which users could create, manage their events, and purchase other events. It makes use of a Rails/PostgreSQL backend, React.js and Redux on the frontend with AWS cloud service for photo storage.

## Features

- Secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt.
- Users can create and edit events.
- Display events based on category.
- Each event has a show page with details.
- Events support images.

## Techonologies

This project was designed to be completed within 10 days. Rails was used as project backend because of its convinient RESTful architecture. Frontend components were builded with React. Most React Components were designed to be reuseable.

## Possible future features

- Search base on locations
- Event following/likes
- Event tickets
